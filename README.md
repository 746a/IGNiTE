## Innovation for Growth in Northern Ireland Tertiary Education

The toolkit is a set of tools for discretionary use, not a rigid set of rules or hierarchy. Innovation occurs when those familiar with a process identify opportunities for improvement and are supported to act. Failure is a natural part of trying something new. As long as no harm occurs, staff should be encouraged to tolerate, seek out, and become comfortable with failure in pursuing innovation.

Documenting innovation, whether successful or not, is essential. Understanding what works, and what doesnâ€™t, provides valuable insights. A strategy that failed in 2024 might prove ideal in 2027.

This toolkit includes methods to help you foster innovation, track progress, and effectively present outcomes to others.
